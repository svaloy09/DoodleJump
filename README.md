# DoodleJump

Doodle Jump game.

This is my very first JS progect and what a better way then this popular game of Doodle Jump!<br>
This game was inspired by Ania Kubow's JS game tutorials for freecodecamp.<br>
Please feel free to download and give it a try yourself. This is just my first iteration of the game.<br>
I do plan on going back and adding a start menu, adding an acutal image to the platformer & creating a new level. <br>

## On my coding journey best lesson i've learned is pick a project and work through it. Happy Coding!ðŸ˜Ž<br>
